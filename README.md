# Project p2p
A peer to peer network with a centralized server, acting as tracker server and torrent searcher

# Getting started
- Run the tracker server: `make server-run`
- Run the peer: `make peer-run`

# TODO
[ ] Implement web UI
[ ] Users must be authenticated to upload metainfo (`.torrent`) files
[ ] Overview of attending peers
[ ] A credit score system, which is to prevent people upload malwares
